## JS Materials

The introduction of the class syntax was a controversial addition. Check out [Not Awesome: ES6 Classes](https://github.com/petsel/not-awesome-es6-classes) or [Is ‚ÄúClass‚Äù In ES6 The New ‚ÄúBad‚Äù Part? on Medium](https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/is-class-in-es6-the-new-bad-part-6c4e6fe1ee65) for more details.

5. [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) :takes you from the basics to interesting stuff quickly. It is a mixture of theory projects and exercises and covers general programming theory as well as the JavaScript language.
6. [Namaste üôè JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlasXeu85E9cQ32gLCvAvr9vNaUccPVNP) is another great and highly recommended free JavaScript tutorial in order to understand how JS works under the hood. Namaste JavaScript is a pure in-depth JavaScript course released for free on YouTube. It will cover the core concepts of JavaScript in detail and everything about how JS works behind the scenes inside the JavaScript engine.

## React Materials

The internet is full of React-related material. However, we use the new style of React for which a large majority of the material found online is outdated.

You may find the following links useful:

- The [official React documentation](https://react.dev/learn) is worth checking out at some point, although most of it will become relevant only later on in the course. Also, everything related to class-based components is irrelevant to us;
- Some courses on [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) like [Start learning React](https://egghead.io/courses/start-learning-react) are of high quality, and the recently updated [Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-reactjs) is also relatively good; both courses introduce concepts that will also be introduced later on in this course. **NB** The first one uses class components but the latter uses the new functional ones.

## Utilization of Large language models

Large language models such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login), [Claude](https://claude.ai/) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) have proven to be very useful in software development.

Personally, I mainly use Copilot, which integrates seamlessly with VS Code thanks to the [plugin](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/github-copilot/).

Copilot is useful in a wide variety of scenarios. Copilot can be asked to generate code for an open file by describing the desired functionality in text:
